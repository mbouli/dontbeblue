### ⁉️ Why
The reason dontbeblue exists is because NewJeans is currently in a legal battle fighting for their rights as artists from their old, abusive company. I wanted to help fans stay connected and also potentially give the girls an easy way to view supportive messages!

### 📋 To-do List
| Task    | Status |
| -------- | ------- |
| Add sorting by most recent / top liked messages |  ⚠️  |
| Add live updating to like counts so users don't need to refresh as often |  ❓  |
| Limit users to one post per hour |  ✅  |
| Implement posting messages |  ✅  |
| Add content filtering to check before posting  |  ✅  |
| Create new post form  |  ✅  |

### 🎨 Design Process
The group previously used their app Phoning to talk with fans, which many fans miss, so my design pulls inspiration from that. Using Figma, I created a design outline that I followed when coding the frontend.
